# odin-landingpage

## Setting up project GitHub repository

- Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it `odin-landingpage` and choose the `public` option instead of the default private.

- Clone that repository onto your local machine. The command should look like git clone `git@github.com:username/odin-landingpage.git (use SSH)`

- `cd` into the `odin-landingpage` project directory that is now on your local machine.

- Set up your `README.md` file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

### Tips on when to commit changes

-  When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.
